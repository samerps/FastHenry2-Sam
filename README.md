# FastHenry

This project is a fork of the repo by [edilorean](https://github.com/ediloren/FastHenry2). The source code has been modified, and some Linux dependent references have been removed such as those related to time calculations. This allows the code to be compiled on Windows using MSYS     

FastHenry is the premium inductance solver originally developed at M.I.T. on Unix platform. A de-facto golden reference standard, FastHenry extracts the inductances and resistances of any arbitrary 3D conductive geometry by solving the Maxwell equations in quasi-static regime.
