In version 2.0, compiling FastHenry on a Silicon Graphics workstation
proved to cause some problems.

Here are a couple of added steps that are necessary to get it going on
an SGI.

1. Do "config sgi" in the fasthenry-2.0 directory.

2. in src/fasthenry/sparse/Makefile,  add the option -cckr to the CFLAGS line:

    CFLAGS = -O -cckr

3. go back up to the fasthenry-2.0 directory, do

    make -k all

  You can ignore the error that ranlib is not found.
