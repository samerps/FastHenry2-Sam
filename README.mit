FastHenry 3.0.1 information.
 
Updated May 28th 2012 by FastFieldSolvers, www.fastfieldsolvers.com

FastHenry is a program for the efficient extraction of inductances and 
resistances of complex 3-D geometries of conductors.  

Configuring for your machine:

  1.  Change to the fasthenry-3.0 directory

     prompt %   cd fasthenry-3.0

  2.  Configure for your machine  (sets the compilation flags)

    SunOS 4.x, IBM RS 6000's, and other 4.2/3 BSD systems(?):
      prompt %   config default

    DEC 5000s:
      prompt %   config dec

    DEC Alphas:
      prompt %   config alpha

    Silicon Graphics:
      prompt %   config sgi 
      and then read the extra instructions in README.sgi

    Linux: 
      prompt % config default

      prompt % config x64
      to force compile for x86 64bit machines

  System V operating systems:

    Sun Solaris:

      prompt %   config solaris

    Hewlett-Packard  HP-UX, and other System V operating systems:
      This has not been thoroughly tested.

      prompt %   config sysV

   Notes:

    a. For Versions of solaris before 2.5, The "ranlib" command is obsolete and
    doesn't exist. 
    Either remove the ranlib command from src/fasthenry/sparse/Makefile
    or define a null ranlib command in your path or do "make -k all"

    b. In the linking stage, if you get an error that "gethostname" 
    is undefined,  then add "-DNO_GETHOSTNAME" to the CFLAGS line in 
    src/fasthenry/Makefile and src/zbuf/Makefile after doing config.  
    For instance

       CFLAGS = -O -DFIVE -DNO_GETHOSTNAME


Compiling:

   prompt %   cd fasthenry-3.0.1
   prompt %   make all

  produces the executables:  fasthenry-3.0.1/bin/fasthenry
                             fasthenry-3.0.1/bin/zbuf
                             fasthenry-3.0.1/bin/ReadOutput
                             fasthenry-3.0.1/bin/MakeLcircuit

  If you want to save space after "make all",

   prompt %   make clean

  will clean up *.o and *.a files.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Major changes in 3.0.1 since version 3.0

- Added various stability bug fixes over original 3.0 distribution

- Added stability improvement under Linux

- Added various includes and other minor updates to avoid warnings
  with latest versions of GCC

- Updated source code to compile on 64 bit machines

- Added Makefile option for 64 bit machines

-------------------------------------------------------------
Major changes in 3.0 since version 2.5

- Specify a nonuniform discretization of a reference plane to
  capture small features in fewer elements.

- Two approaches for generating spice equivalent circuits are available:

  1. An equivalent circuit for a single frequency.

  2. A circuit which models the frequency
    dependent resistances and   inductances through a reduced state-space
    representation

   Comments:  Method 1 will not model frequency dependent resistance
   and inductance since it gives and R and L at the single specified
   frequency.  Method 2 will model the full effects up to some frequency.

- Major Bug fix:
    For reference planes which form segments with different
    widths in the x-direction versus the Y direction, the sizes weren't
    computed correctly in version 2.0 and above.  This has been fixed.


- The zbuf program now takes the ``-m'' argument to produce a
  Matlab file for faster visualization in matlab.  This is very beneficial for
  large files since producing the postscript file can take $n^2$ time.
  The matlab file can be viewed within matlab with the
  fasthenry-3.0/bin/plotfastH.m matlab function.  The file 
  zbuffile.mat would be produced with ``zbuf -m zbuffile'' which can
  then be viewed in matlab with ``>> plotfastH('zbuffile.mat')''.
  Also, you can modify the file src/zbuf/dump_struct.c to output in YOUR own
  format instead of matlab.

-  Sparse preconditioner.  Specify  -p shells to use a
   preconditioner based on Byron Krauter's sparse inductance technique.

-  Regurgitate the input file with -v to see what FastHenry
   thinks it has read.  Also can translate and reflect geometry before output.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since Version 1.0

Version 1.5:

 1.  Better filament mutual inductance approximation for very thin segments.
 2.  Ability to specify ground plane holes.  See example hole.inp and
     some of the comments toward the end of the file hole.c  (I have
     not had a chance to update the manual.)
 3.  Other command line options.  (Give an erroneous option at the command line
     to see the added options)
 4.  Some bug fixes.


Version 2.0 - this is a far improvement over the past versions

 In summary:
 1. A better preconditioner which allows efficient analysis of 
    reference planes.
 2. Accurate modeling with thin filaments.
 3. More detailed manual
 4. Many, many other features
